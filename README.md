# PokeArch

## Objectives
- **Application Architecture:** MVVM Pattern with Clean Architecture.
- **Integrate Key Features:** List of pokemons, Detail Screen, Favorite Screen, Feature that comunicate with our mobile.
- **Implement Third-party APIs:** PokeApi.

## Description

The primary purpose of this application is to focus on implementing a modern software architecture and best coding practices. The project objectives include:
- Determining the most suitable architectural pattern (e.g., Clean Architecture, MVVM) to improve code organization and maintainability.
- Integrating key features that allow users to explore Pokémon, view details, and manage their favorites.
- Utilizing third-party APIs to enhance the app's functionality.

This project serves as a valuable learning experience for developers looking to refine their skills in software architecture and best coding practices. It simulates a scenario where a new application is being developed from scratch, ensuring that it is built using modern standards to ensure adaptability and efficiency.

- **Android Studio:** The primary development environment for building the Android app.
- **Kotlin:** The programming languages used for app development.
- **Jetpack Compose:** Android library for declarative UI creation.
- **Room:** Android database library for local data storage.
- **Retrofit:** A type-safe HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Coroutines:** Used for handling asynchronous operations more easily.
- **Version Catalogs:** Simplify dependency management and updates.
- **Material 2 and 3:** Updated Android Material Design for UI components.
- **Android Framework:** Core components and tools for Android app development.
